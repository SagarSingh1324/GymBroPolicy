    </div>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Gamr is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our game tracking application handles your information while providing you with the latest gaming trends, search capabilities, and personal gaming organization features.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>Gamr is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information to our servers or any third parties. Specifically, we do not collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
        <li>User account information or registration data</li>
        <li>Game search queries or browsing history</li>
        <li>Wishlist contents or gaming preferences</li>
        <li>Play session data or game time tracking information</li>
        <li>Device identifiers or location data</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
        <li>Any other personal or sensitive information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data you choose to save in Gamr, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Game information fetched from IGDB (titles, descriptions, release dates, genres)</li>
        <li>Personal wishlists and game collections</li>
        <li>Play session logs and game time tracking</li>
        <li>Game completion status and progress notes</li>
        <li>App preferences and settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>is stored locally on your device only. This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>

    <h2>IGDB API Integration</h2>
    <p>Gamr uses the IGDB (Internet Game Database) API to provide you with game information, trends, and search capabilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We use our own API credentials to access IGDB services</li>
        <li>Your search queries are sent directly to IGDB but are not logged or stored by us</li>
        <li>Game data retrieved from IGDB is cached locally on your device for performance</li>
        <li>No personal information is shared with IGDB or any third-party services</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing Features</h2>
    <p>Gamr allows you to share your wishlists and game collections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sharing creates a simple text string that you can copy and paste</li>
        <li>This sharing is handled by your device's built-in sharing capabilities</li>
        <li>We do not process, store, or have access to any shared content</li>
        <li>The content you choose to share is entirely under your control</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all your data remains on your device, you maintain complete control over your information. We recommend:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keeping your device secure with appropriate lock screen protection</li>
        <li>Regularly backing up your device if you want to preserve your Gamr data</li>
        <li>Being aware that uninstalling the app will permanently delete all your local data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>No User Accounts Required</h2>
    <p>Gamr does not require you to create an account, register, or provide any personal information to use the app. You can immediately start browsing games, creating wishlists, and tracking your gaming sessions without any registration process.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Gamr does not integrate with or use any third-party services beyond the IGDB API for game data. We do not use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analytics platforms or tracking services</li>
        <li>Advertising networks or marketing tools</li>
        <li>Social media integrations or external APIs</li>
        <li>Cloud storage or backup services</li>
        <li>Crash reporting or debugging tools that collect user data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Gamr does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. Since we don't collect any personal information from any users, this policy applies to users of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and will take effect immediately upon posting. Your continued use of Gamr after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can delete individual games, wishlists, or session entries within the app</li>
        <li>You can clear all data through the app's settings</li>
        <li>Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all associated data</li>
    </ul>
